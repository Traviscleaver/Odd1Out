# Off Beat

Off Beat is a Project Game made for Fall Hacks 2025

This game was made using the inspiritation of the popular youtube channel Odd1Out and everyones love for music.
It works by uploading users spotify API music data and using this data to then pick a song for players to use.
The game then randomly selects a user to be the imposter and not know the song while the other players are shown the song. The imposter then needs to fit in with the players until either they are caught or convince the other players to pick someone else. They need to pretend to know the song as well. 


This game was developed in two days by Travis, Benny, and Johnny.
